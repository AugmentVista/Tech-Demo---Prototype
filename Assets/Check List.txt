In place of a health system that uses damage and healing this game will function closer to SUPERHOT 
in that velocity and "Ammo" are your health. The player should always be moving, at least a little bit.


                                          TO DO LIST:
1. Modify the character controller script to uncap max velocity and more harshly limit acceleration.
2. Add functionality to checkpoint script to reset the number of ability uses when the player respawns to that checkpoint.
3. Create an invisible Navmesh both on the land and air for different enemy types. 
4. When any enemy knocks into the player it should apply a force to the players rigidbody relative to the impact force.
5. Experiment with whether or not a cap between intervals that the player can use their platform ability.
